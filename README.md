How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  I can ensure my program is functional and secure by using testing methods to verify functionality and security. When testing it is important to ensure and validate the functionality through rounds and various forms of testing. Using mainly both statis and dynamic testing where applicable and using the latest tools available for your testing as well. Having a high code covereage as well is also important. Making sure over 90% of the code has been testing and validated is important to ensure security and reliabilty. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  Taking the requirements is one of the most important aspects of software development. So much can be lost if requirements are not understood and taken clearly so it is imperitive that communication is present and the requirements are interpreted correctly.
  
How do I approach designing software?
  I approach software design using the SDLC, software design lifecycle. Starting from the origination of the idea, the business justiication and requirement creation, the transition to the development team and creating of sprint/development timeline, and lastly, testing and maintenence if needed. During this time everything done is designed from start to finish.
